Whenever you type a letter on a keyboard, a computer interprets this signal from the keyboard as a code, since every key produces a code. A computer then follows a series of steps: it finds and recognizes a letter as a font from its memory. Since letters are made up of lines and circles, a computer also needs to recognize the corresponding combinations that create specific letters. The memory of a computer that manages the screen then holds a little box of pixels with the lines and circles of the letter that was pressed on the keyboard.
