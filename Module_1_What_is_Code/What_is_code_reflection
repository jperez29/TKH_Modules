1) Whenever you type a letter on a keyboard, a computer interprets this signal from the keyboard as a code, 
since every key produces a code. A computer then follows a series of steps: it finds and recognizes a 
letter as a font from its memory. Since letters are made up of lines and circles, a computer also needs
to recognize the corresponding combinations that create specific letters. The memory of a computer that 
manages the screen then holds a little box of pixels with the lines and circles of the letter that was 
pressed on the keyboard.  

2) Computers use input and output to create experiences by taking a userâ€™s input, processing this information, 
and converting it to computer language in order to have a response from the computer to the user. For example, 
when you speak to Siri, the input is the words spoken to Siri, which Siri cannot understand. Siri breaks down 
your words to text, which then recognizes them as symbols and compares those symbols to the symbols in its database. 
Another example is scanning products at a grocery store. The input is the code on the product, and the computer 
compares the code to something it understands to get an output to the user, the output being the price of the item 
of purchase.
