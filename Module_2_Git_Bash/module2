1) Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes of files where your code
lives, whereas github is a public platform where you can host Git repositories. Another way
to think about it is Git works on your local computer while Github works as an online platform to save and 
store your code.

2) We can use the terminal to talk to the computer directly and this is more efficient for creating 
file structures for projects than using GUIs.

3) Three benefits of version control are it allows multiple people to work on the same projects, it tracks 
changes made to your code over time, and it allows you to go back to prior versions if the recent versions 
don't work.
